This repository contains the code used to process and analyze the model output and plot the results presented in

Tesdal, J.-E., MacGilchrist, A. G., Beadling, R. L., Griffies, S. M., Krasting, J. P., & Durack, P. J. (2023). *Revisiting interior water mass responses to surface forcing changes and the subsequent effects on overturning in the Southern Ocean*. **Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans**, 128, e2022JC019105. doi: 10.1029/2022JC019105.

Seperate Jupyter notebooks are provided for each figure and table presented in [Tesdal et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JC019105). Custom functions used in the notebooks are stored in `scripts/`, while the Jupyter notebooks used for data processing and analysis are stored in `processing/`. The data files required to reproduce all figures and tables can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7679544.
